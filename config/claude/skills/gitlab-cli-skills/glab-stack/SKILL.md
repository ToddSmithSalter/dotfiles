# glab stack

## Overview

```

  Stacked diffs are a way of creating small changes that build upon each other to ultimately deliver a feature. This    
  kind of workflow can be used to accelerate development time by continuing to build upon your changes, while earlier   
  changes in the stack are reviewed and updated based on feedback.                                                      
                                                                                                                        
  This feature is experimental. It might be broken or removed without any prior notice.

  Use experimental features at your own risk.

## Quick start

```bash
glab stack --help
```

## v1.89.0 Updates

> **v1.89.0+:** `glab stack sync` has a new `--update-base` flag that rebases the stack onto the updated base branch before syncing.

```bash
# Sync stack and rebase onto updated base branch (v1.89.0+)
glab stack sync --update-base
```

Use `--update-base` when the base branch (e.g. `main`) has been updated and you want to rebase your entire stack on top of it before pushing.

## Subcommands

See [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for full `--help` output.
