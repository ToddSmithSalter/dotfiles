## Quick start

```bash
glab duo --help
```

## v1.87.0 Changes

### Binary download management
As of v1.87.0, `glab duo` includes a CLI binary download management command for installing and updating the GitLab Duo AI binary.

```bash
# Download/update the Duo CLI binary
glab duo update

# Check current Duo binary version
glab duo --version
```

**When to use:** Run `glab duo update` after upgrading glab to ensure the Duo AI binary matches your CLI version. If `glab duo ask` stops working after a glab upgrade, this is usually the fix.

## v1.88.0 Changes

### `glab duo help` subcommand

```bash
# Show help for all duo commands
glab duo help

# Show help for a specific subcommand
glab duo help ask
```

## Subcommands

See [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for full `--help` output.
