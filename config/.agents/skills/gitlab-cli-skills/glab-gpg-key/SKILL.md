```bash

```

## v1.89.0 Updates

> **v1.89.0+:** `glab gpg-key list` and `glab gpg-key get` support `--output json` / `-F json` for structured output, ideal for agent automation.

```bash
# List GPG keys with JSON output (v1.89.0+)
glab gpg-key list --output json
glab gpg-key list -F json

# Get a specific GPG key with JSON output (v1.89.0+)
glab gpg-key get <key-id> --output json
glab gpg-key get <key-id> -F json
```
