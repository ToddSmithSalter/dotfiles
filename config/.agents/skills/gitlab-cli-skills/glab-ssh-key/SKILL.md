    add [key-file] [--flags]   Add an SSH key to your GitLab account.
    delete <key-id> [--flags]  Deletes a single SSH key specified by the ID.
    get <key-id> [--flags]     Returns a single SSH key specified by the ID.
    list [--flags]             Get a list of SSH keys for the currently authenticated user.
         
  FLAGS  
         
    -h --help                  Show help for this command.

## ⚠️ Security Warning: Public Keys Only

**Always verify you are uploading a PUBLIC key, not a private key.**

- ✅ Public keys: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (`.pub` extension)
- ❌ Private keys: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (no extension — NEVER upload these)

Uploading a private key to GitLab would expose your credentials. Double-check the filename before running `glab ssh-key add`.

```bash
# ✅ Safe — public key
glab ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --title "My Laptop"

# ❌ NEVER do this — private key
# glab ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 --title "My Laptop"
```

**Before uploading, verify your key is public:**
```bash
# Should start with 'ssh-rsa', 'ssh-ed25519', 'ecdsa-sha2-*', etc.
head -c 20 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

## Quick start

```bash
glab ssh-key --help
```

## v1.89.0 Updates

> **v1.89.0+:** `glab ssh-key list` and `glab ssh-key get` support `--output json` / `-F json` for structured output, ideal for agent automation.

```bash
# List SSH keys with JSON output (v1.89.0+)
glab ssh-key list --output json
glab ssh-key list -F json

# Get a specific SSH key with JSON output (v1.89.0+)
glab ssh-key get <key-id> --output json
glab ssh-key get <key-id> -F json
```

## Subcommands

See [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for full `--help` output.
